# DockerIntro
A repository containing all the files you need to create a Docker Container running Apache2.

This project has been created to describe recent work I have done on Docker. I have made it to hopefully help people who want to get started with Docker and creating their own Docker containers!

I am open to project ideas and siggestions, as I would love to continue to build up my knowledge on this area.
